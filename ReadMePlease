#So this is our sorting simulator. We are going to have multiple function files
#for the various sorts. proj contains general information I wrote about the
#project. the um script contains a very short example of the pause function
#Files:
#RunMePlease - a.k.a. the script
#this is the file that will be run, will ask users for input right out the gate
#will ask the sort, the order, the number of items, and the speed
#once it runs the user will be asked if they want to Start New, Change Sort, or Exit the program
#BubbleSort(arr, s)
#CountingSort(arr, s)
#HeapSort(arr, s)
#InsertionSort(arr, s)
#SelectionSort(arr, s)
#The sorts above work essentially the same, they are each called once by the script
#if the user selects that sort
#Inside each function, every time something changes, a new bar graph is made.
